In this project we pretend to acess the database UniProt, extract the data from various proteins
and then develop a classifier.
The first fasta file only contains proteins with catalytic activity (AC) (target = 1).
The second one contains all the human proteins. We identify the ones present in the first
file as containing AC and the other with non containing AC.
After the dataset was built we balanced the data and then we splitted intro train and test and a SVM
was applied. The results are shown in the output.txt file and in the roc_curve_2000.png
